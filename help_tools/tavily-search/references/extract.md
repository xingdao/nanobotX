                            intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is
                            intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly
                            computer systems. It is a field of research in
                            computer science that develops and studies methods
                            and software that enable machines to perceive their
                            environment and use learning and intelligence to
                            take actions that maximize their chances of
                            achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be
                            called AIs.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include
                            advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search);
                            recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and
                            Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google
                            Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles
                            (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g.,
                            ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and
                            analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and
                            Go)...................
