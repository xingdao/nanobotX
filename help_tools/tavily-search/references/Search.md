                    Controls the latency vs. relevance tradeoff and how
                    `results[].content` is generated:

                    - `advanced`: Highest relevance with increased latency. Best
                    for detailed, high-precision queries. Returns multiple
                    semantically relevant snippets per URL (configurable via
                    `chunks_per_source`).

                    - `basic`: A balanced option for relevance and latency.
                    Ideal for general-purpose searches. Returns one NLP summary
                    per URL.

                    - `fast`: Prioritizes lower latency while maintaining good
                    relevance. Returns multiple semantically relevant snippets
                    per URL (configurable via `chunks_per_source`).

                    - `ultra-fast`: Minimizes latency above all else. Best for
                    time-critical use cases. Returns one NLP summary per URL.


                    **Cost**:

                    - `basic`, `fast`, `ultra-fast`: 1 API Credit

                    - `advanced`: 2 API Credits

                    Chunks are short content snippets (maximum 500 characters
                    each) pulled directly from the source. Use
                    `chunks_per_source` to define the maximum number of relevant
                    chunks returned per source and to control the `content`
                    length. Chunks will appear in the `content` field as:
                    `<chunk 1> [...] <chunk 2> [...] <chunk 3>`. Available only

                    configures search parameters based on your query's content
                    and intent. You can still set other parameters manually, and
                    your explicit values will override the automatic ones. The
                    parameters `include_answer`, `include_raw_content`, and
                    `max_results` must always be set manually, as they directly
                    affect response size. Note: `search_depth` may be
                    automatically set to advanced when it's likely to improve
                    results. This uses 2 API credits per request. To avoid the
                    extra cost, you can explicitly set `search_depth` to
                    `basic`.

                      Lionel Messi, born in 1987, is an Argentine footballer
                      widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his
                      generation. He spent the majority of his career playing
                      for FC Barcelona, where he won numerous domestic league
                      titles and UEFA Champions League titles. Messi is known
                      for his exceptional dribbling skills, vision, and
                      goal-scoring ability. He has won multiple FIFA Ballon d'Or
                      awards, numerous La Liga titles with Barcelona, and holds
                      the record for most goals scored in a calendar year. In
                      2014, he led Argentina to the World Cup final, and in
                      2015, he helped Barcelona capture another treble. Despite
                      turning 36 in June, Messi remains highly influential in
                      the sport.
