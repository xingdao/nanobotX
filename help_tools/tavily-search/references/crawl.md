                          -----------


                          We're a team of AI researchers and developers
                          passionate about helping you build the next generation
                          of AI assistants. Our mission is to empower
                          individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased,
                          and factual information.


                          What is the Tavily Search Engine?

                          ---------------------------------


                          Building an AI agent that leverages realtime online
                          information is not a simple task. Scraping doesn't
                          scale and requires expertise to refine, current search
                          engine APIs don't provide explicit information to
                          queries but simply potential related articles (which
                          are not always related), and are not very customziable
                          for AI agent needs. This is why we're excited to
                          introduce the first search engine for AI agents -
                          [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/).


                          Tavily is a search engine optimized for LLMs, aimed at
                          efficient, quick and persistent search results. Unlike
                          other search APIs such as Serp or Google, Tavily
                          focuses on optimizing search for AI developers and
                          autonomous AI agents. We take care of all the burden
                          of searching, scraping, filtering and extracting the
                          most relevant information from online sources. All in
                          a single API call!


                          To try the API in action, you can now use our hosted
                          version on our [API
                          Playground](https://app.tavily.com/playground).


                          Why choose Tavily?

                          ------------------


                          Tavily shines where others fail, with a Search API
                          optimized for LLMs.


                          How does the Search API work?

                          -----------------------------


                          Traditional search APIs such as Google, Serp and Bing
                          retrieve search results based on a user query.
                          However, the results are sometimes irrelevant to the
                          goal of the search, and return simple URLs and
                          snippets of content which are not always relevant.
                          Because of this, any developer would need to then
                          scrape the sites to extract relevant content, filter
                          irrelevant information, optimize the content to fit
                          LLM context limits, and more. This task is a burden
                          and requires a lot of time and effort to complete. The
                          Tavily Search API takes care of all of this for you in
                          a single API call.


                          The Tavily Search API aggregates up to 20 sites per a
                          single API call, and uses proprietary AI to score,
                          filter and rank the top most relevant sources and
                          content to your task, query or goal. In addition,
                          Tavily allows developers to add custom fields such as
                          context and limit response tokens to enable the
                          optimal search experience for LLMs.


                          Tavily can also help your AI agent make better
                          decisions by including a short answer for cross-agent
                          communication.
